Note: Refer to this only wen you have completed atleast the basics of django.
      Use the tutorial and if you get stuck somewhere yoy can always refer to the code in this project.
      The code isn't exactly same as in the tutorial. It has a few additions and deletions.

{{ variable_name }}

	# The above code is to used to get the value of the variable.
  	  The variable is passed in the Url from views.py file using 'context'.

{% for obj in objects_list %}
	do_something
{% endfor %}

	# The above code is to use for loop in django templates.
  	  Here, objects_list is a variable(list of objects) passedin the views.py

{% if variable_name == value %}
	do_something
{% elif %}
	do_something
{% else %}
	do_something
{% endif %}

	# The above code is to use if statement in django templates.
  	  Here, variable_name is a variable passed in the views.py

{% block block_name %}
	Html goes here
{% endblock %}

	# block tag is just used to define blocks it doesn,t make any difference to
	  your present html code but it finds it's application in extending templates.

{% extends 'folder_name/base.html' %}
	# The above is called extends template tag. It is used when the entire list
	  of webpages in our application are same except for some few changes.
	  To do this we create a base.html present in templates/folder_name/ and define blocks.
	  Now when we extend this block and redefine the block it automatically renders the base.html
	  except that the contents of the block are replaced with the newly defined contents.
